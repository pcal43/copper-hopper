# MobFilter

MobFilter is Minecraft mod that allows you to limit spawning of mobs in your world.  You can use it to 
* Create safe zones in your world where mobs aren't allowed to spawn.
* Completely prevent particular mobs from ever spawning
* Limit mob spawning to specific biomes, times, or light levels
* ...and more

MobFilter uses the Fabric modloader and runs only on the server.

## Usage

MobFilter uses a flexible, rule-based filtering system that you configure.  When Minecraft wants to spawn
a new mob, MobFilter checks the rules you provide to see if the spawn should be 'vetoed.'

The first time you run Minecraft with the mobfilter jar installed, an empty configuration file will be
created in `config/mobfilter.yml`.  Just edit this file to set up your rules.  The rules will take effect the
next time you start a world.

Rules can test for several conditions, including:
* Block Position
* Location (Biome, World, Dimension, BlockId)
* Mob Type (EntiyId or SpawnGroup)
* Time of Day
* Light Level

The [default mobfilter configuration file](https://github.com/pcal43/mob-filter/blob/main/src/main/resources/default-mobfilter.yaml) 
provides more detail on setting up rules.


## Examples

#### Prevent hostile mobs from spawning above sea level in a specific part of the world

```
rules:
  - name: Safe Zone
    what: DISALLOW_SPAWN
    when:
      spawnGroup : [MONSTER]
      blockX     : [-128, 234]
      blockY     : [63, MAX]
      blockZ     : [-321, 512]
```

#### Prevent creepers from ever spawning and also prevent squid from spawning in rivers
```
rules:
  - name: No Creepers Ever
    what: DISALLOW_SPAWN
    when:
      entityId : [minecraft:creeper]

  - name: No Freshwater Squid
    what: DISALLOW_SPAWN
    when:
      entityId  : [minecraft:squid]
      biomeId   : [minecraft:river, minecraft:frozen_river]
```
