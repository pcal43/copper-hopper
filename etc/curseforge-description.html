    <b>Copper Hopper</b> adds a new kind of hopper that you can use to filter which items get
    pulled and pushed. They help you more easily build item sorting systems while keeping in
    the spirit of vanilla Minecraft.

<h3>How does it work exactly?</h3>
Copper Hoppers try to approximate the way vanilla item sorters work.  They're just like a regular hopper except:
<ul>
    <li>They never accept an item of a type that is not already held in the hopper.</li>
    <li>They always keep the last item of a type that is held in the hopper.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    So, just put an item in one of the regular hopper slots to "set" a filter. That item will never be pulled or pushed
    out of the hopper. And the hopper will now only accept items of that type.

<h3>Lithium Users Read This!</h3>
<p>
    If you also use Lithium, Copper Hoppers won't work unless you set <code>mixin.block.hopper=false</code>
    in your <code>lithium.properties</code> file.  This will disable Lithium's hopper-related optimizations
    that are incompatible with Copper Hoppers.  (Courtesy of <a href='https://www.curseforge.com/members/valkonmc'>valkonmc</a>)

<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The item texture for Copper Hopper was contributed by <a href='https://github.com/ppblitto'>Pablo Henrique</a>.  (Thanks!)</li>
    <li>Copper Hopper was inspired by Mr. Crayfish's excellent <a href='https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/golden-hopper'>Golden Hopper</a> mod.</li>
    <li>I will not be doing a Forge port of Copper Hopper. (sorry)</li>
