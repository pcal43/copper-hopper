<p><b>MobFilter</b> lets you limit mob spawning in your world so that you can</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a safe zone around your base where hostile mobs don't spawn</li>
<li>Completely prevent certain mobs from ever spawning</li>
<li>Prevent mobs from spawning in certain biomes</li>
<li>...and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>MobFilter uses a flexible, rules-based filtering system. When Minecraft wants to spawn a new mob, MobFilter checks the rules you have configured to see if the spawn should be 'vetoed.'</p>
<p>MobFilter uses the <b>Fabric</b> modloader and is <b>server-only</b> (so it works with vanilla clients)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first time you run Minecraft with the mobfilter jar installed, an empty configuration file will be created in `config/mobfilter.yml`. Just edit this file to set up your rules and they'll take effect the next time you start a world.</p>
<p>Rules can test for several conditions, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Block Position</li>
<li>Location (Biome, World, Dimension, BlockId)</li>
<li>Mob Type (EntiyId or SpawnGroup)</li>
<li>Time of Day</li>
<li>Light Level</li>
</ul>
<p>See the <a href="https://github.com/pcal43/mob-filter/blob/main/src/main/resources/default-mobfilter.yaml">default configuration file</a> for examples and more detail on setting up rules.</p>

<h2>Why This Mod?</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I wrote this mod because I wanted to be able to be able to play survival minecraft with my daughter, and that meant we had to have a mob-free area around our base. There are numerous other mods out there that manage mob spawning but none of them did quite what I needed them to do.</p>
