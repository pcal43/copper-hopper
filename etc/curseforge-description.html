    <b>MobFilter</b> lets you limit mob spawning in your world so that you can
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Create a safe zone around your base where hostile mobs don't spawn</li>
    <li>Completely prevent certain mobs from ever spawning</li>
    <li>Prevent mobs from spawning in certain biomes</li>
    <li>...and more.</li>
</ul>
<p>
    MobFilter uses a flexible, rules-based filtering system.  When Minecraft wants to spawn a new mob, MobFilter
    checks the rules you have configured to see if the spawn should be 'vetoed.'
</p>

<p>
    MobFilter uses the <b>Fabric</b> modloader and is <b>server-only</b> (so it works with vanilla clients)
</p>

<p></p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p></p>

<p>
    The first time you run Minecraft with the mobfilter jar installed, an empty configuration file will be
    created in `config/mobfilter.yml`.  Just edit this file to set up your rules and they'll take effect the
    next time you start a world.
</p>

<p>
    Rules can test for several conditions, including:
</p>
<ul>
    <li>Block Position</li>
    <li>Location (Biome, World, Dimension, BlockId)</li>
    <li>Mob Type (EntiyId or SpawnGroup)</li>
    <li>Time of Day</li>
    <li>Light Level</li>
</ul>

<p>
    See the <a href='https://github.com/pcal43/mob-filter/blob/main/src/main/resources/default-mobfilter.yaml'>default configuration file</a>
    for examples and more detail on setting up rules.

<h2>Why This Mod?</h2>
<p></p>

<p>
    I wrote this mod because I wanted to be able to be able to play survival minecraft with my daughter, and
    that meant we had to have a mob-free area around our base.  There are numerous other mods out there that
    manage mob spawning but none of them did quite what I needed them to do.
